# What is it?
This script opens an emulated version of a browser, runs Telegram where you log in with your account, and reports messages in 200+ propaganda channels on your behalf.
The script was developed by https://github.com/deli841. Message or email me (841deli@gmail.com) in case you have any questions or want to contribute to the Telegram channel database or the algorithm.

**It is also crucial to keep the number of reports high, so please share the project with your friends!**

# How to use it?
To work with the software, you’ll need to install Python and Git:

- To install Python, follow the instructions for your OS here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-384/
- To install Git, follow the instructions here: https://github.com/git-guides/install-git

Note that you should not have two-step verification enabled - it is not supported by the script as of now. we are working to implement this feature soon. You can turn off this feature by doing the following on Telegram on your phone: `Settings -> Privacy and Security -> Two step verification -> Off`


## For Windows Users:

1. Clone git repo.
    1. Open any folder on your laptop, run cmd in that folder, and type 
	`git clone https://github.com/deli841/tg_reporter` 
2. Open the folder cloned from GitHub and copy the full path (let’s call it `<MY PATH>`).
3. In Windows Search Bar, enter cmd and choose the first option.
4. In the terminal, run cd `<MY PATH>`
5. Run `python -m venv venv`
6. Activate your venv: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
7. Install all dependencies: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
8. Install Chrome Simulator: `python installer.py`
9. Run the code: `python main.py`
10. You will be able to see your laptop open the Chrome browser. **Please do not enter or press anything manually in the open browser window.**  Interacting directly with the user interface will break the script. The browser window is there for you to see what is going on in your Telegram. **Enter all the information through the terminal when prompted (phone number and login code).** Please be aware that this information is not stored anywhere and is inaccessible from outside your device.

Instructions for Linux and MacOS platforms are coming soon.

## Notes:
- In case something does not work, try rerunning all of the scripts again.
- In case you accidentally interact with the browser window and the script breaks, exit, and run python main.py again.
- In case the script encounters a message it cannot report, it will try several times and move on to the next Telegram channel.
- **To stop the script, press Ctrl + C in the cmd. Closing the browser window does not stop the script.**
